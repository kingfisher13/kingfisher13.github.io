Corkboard, Saa Paper (handmade Thai mulberry fiber paper), Acrylic Paint, Luggage Tags, and Stamps on Plexiglass with custom made leather straps holding it against the wall.

Made for my wife as a wedding present.  It wasnâ€™t completed until the summer of 2014, even though it was presented before our wedding several years earlier.
